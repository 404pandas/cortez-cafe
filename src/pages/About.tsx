      </Typography>

      <Typography variant='body1' color='text.primary' sx={{ mb: 4 }}>
        Nestled in the heart of the historic fishing village of Cortez, Florida,
        Cortez Cafe has been a beloved gathering spot since the 1970s.
        Originally a haven for local fishermen to share stories over hearty
        breakfasts and bottomless coffee, the cafe has maintained its warm,
        welcoming atmosphere through the decades.

        A Legacy of Hospitality
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant='body1' color='text.primary' sx={{ mb: 4 }}>
        In 2002, Sam and Debi Varelis took over the cafe, bringing with them a
        passion for home-style cooking and community. They expanded the space in
        2003, nearly doubling its size, yet preserving its cozy charm. Their
        dedication to generous portions and friendly service has turned
        first-time visitors into lifelong regulars.

        At Cortez Cafe, it's common to see locals and tourists sharing tables,
        engaging in conversations that span from fishing tales to daily news.
        The cafe serves as a community hub where friendships are forged over
        plates of fluffy pancakes, savory omelets, and homemade pies crafted
        from Debi's cherished family recipes.
